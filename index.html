				<h2>Recipe</h2>
				<p>Easy blackberry cobbler. My father-in-law grows huge blackberries and always has tons. I tried a number of recipes and none really hit the spot. So created this one and it worked so well that my fiance said it was the best she had ever had. Serve warm with heavy or whipped cream.</p>
